# Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System

Vehicles have a number of different systems including hydraulic, mechanical, electrical, electronic, and chemical. Functional safety is a part of overall automotive safety and specifically refers to reducing risks in electrical and electronic systems. It looks at what happens when the system does something that it was not supposed to do, which is called a malfunction. Functional safety standards for the automotive industry in systems engineering - ISO 26262, is used to methodically reduce risk in passenger vehicle's electric/electronic systems.
